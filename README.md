  ## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
  This simple website lets users easily take and keep track of notes. All they have to do is fill out the note, and click save. <br> Creating this program was a nice reminder on how to use a basic json database, instead of an SQL table. 
  
  ## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

  Use it to keep track of your notes! Once you get on the notes pages, type in your new note, and click save! You can view the note again by clicking on it on the left, and make a new note by clicking "new note" in the top right.
